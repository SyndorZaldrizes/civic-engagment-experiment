          <h2>Welcome, Future Delegates</h2>
          <p>
            This is the youth corner of the Civic Engagement Experiment &amp; Lab. The goal here is
            simple: break big political ideas into pieces you can actually use. No partisan spin,
            no endless horse-race coverage&mdash;just how government works, how decisions get made,
            and what it looks like when real people push back against “the spectacle” and do
            democracy on purpose.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can use this page in a few ways:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Students &amp; younger siblings:</strong> Start with the explainers and “missions.”</li>
            <li><strong>Parents &amp; educators:</strong> Treat this as a menu of low-stress civic activities.</li>
            <li><strong>Clubs &amp; delegations:</strong> Use the missions as warm-ups for deeper work or simulations.</li>
          </ul>

        <!-- CIVICS CRASH COURSE -->
        <section>
          <h2>Quick Civics: What Are We Even Doing Here?</h2>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>What does government do?</h3>
            <p>
              Government isn’t just “people arguing on TV.” At its best, it’s how a community
              decides together what to do about shared problems:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Who gets to use which resources (schools, parks, roads, internet)?</li>
              <li>What happens when people disagree or break the rules?</li>
              <li>How money is collected (taxes) and how it’s spent.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If you’ve ever argued over who takes the trash out or who gets the last slice of
              pizza, you’ve already had a very tiny version of a political debate.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Levels of government (in plain language)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Local:</strong> Town, city, or county. Handles things like bus routes,
                zoning, local parks, libraries, and some policing.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>State:</strong> In the U.S., each state has its own legislature, courts,
                and governor. They deal with education systems, state roads, many criminal laws,
                and how elections are run.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>National (federal):</strong> Congress, the President, and federal courts
                handle nationwide issues like immigration, national defense, and federal taxes.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In real life, all three levels overlap. That’s why it gets confusing&mdash;and why
              learning who actually makes which decision is one of your first real “power skills.”
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Rights, responsibilities, and power</h3>
            <p>
              Democracies don’t run on vibes alone. They run on:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Rights:</strong> Things the government is not supposed to take from you.</li>
              <li><strong>Responsibilities:</strong> Things you’re expected to do (like follow laws, serve on a jury).</li>
              <li>
                <strong>Power:</strong> Who actually gets listened to when decisions are made. Voting is one piece of that,
                but so are organizing, speaking, creating, and showing up together.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </section>

        <!-- MISSIONS -->
        <section>
          <h2>Your First Civic Missions</h2>
          <p>
            These “missions” are designed to be doable in 15–30 minutes each. They work for middle
            school, high school, or intro-level college students with light tweaks.
          </p>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Mission 1: Map Your Power</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Pick one issue you actually care about (school lunch, buses, rent, climate, etc.).</li>
              <li>Ask: <em>Who decides this where I live?</em> Local, state, or national?</li>
              <li>
                Look up:
                <ul>
                  <li>Your city/town council or county commissioners.</li>
                  <li>Your state legislators.</li>
                  <li>Your members of Congress.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Write down one way each level <em>could</em> influence your issue.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="small">
              <strong>For teachers:</strong> Have students build a quick “power map” on the board
              or in a shared doc. It’s chaotic but memorable.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Mission 2: Spot the Spectacle</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Pick a news clip, social post, or meme about politics.</li>
              <li>
                Ask:
                <ul>
                  <li>Is this telling me anything concrete about a decision or policy?</li>
                  <li>Or is it mostly about dunking, drama, and making one side look cool?</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Label it:
                <strong>information</strong>, <strong>spectacle</strong>, or a mix.
              </li>
              <li>Write one question you’d ask to turn it into something more useful.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="small">
              The point isn’t to never enjoy the show&mdash;it’s to notice when the show is
              replacing actual decision-making, which is where democratic erosion sneaks in.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Mission 3: Practice a Micro-Debate</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Choose a school or local issue with two or more real sides.</li>
              <li>In pairs or small groups, assign roles (for/against, or different solutions).</li>
              <li>
                Set rules: each person gets 1 minute to speak, no interruptions, and each side must
                summarize the other side’s point before responding.
              </li>
              <li>Afterwards, debrief: what felt respectful, what didn’t, and what you learned.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="small">
              This isn’t about “winning.” It’s training for listening, which is a surprisingly rare
              civic skill.

              This page is designed as a nonpartisan resource. It doesn’t endorse candidates or
              specific policies. Instead, it treats civic skills as something you can practice the

              Ways you can use this hub:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Classroom warm-ups:</strong> Use one “mission” as a 15–20 minute starter
                before a longer lesson.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Club programming:</strong> Student governments, MSL delegations, or service
                clubs can run these as low-stakes activities before bigger simulations or projects.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Family conversations:</strong> Pick one question (“who makes this decision?”
                or “is this information or spectacle?”) at dinner or in the car.
              </li>

          <h2>How This Fits into the Civic Engagement Experiment</h2>
          <div class="card">
            <p>
              This youth hub isn’t just a resource; it’s also part of a larger experiment. The
              Civic Engagement Experiment &amp; Lab is trying to answer questions like:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Which activities actually help young people feel more confident about politics?</li>
              <li>How do different messages land with students who feel “out of place” politically?</li>
              <li>Can small, local experiences push back against big, abstract democratic erosion?</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              If you’re interested in helping test these ideas on a campus or in a classroom, you
              can explore:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="study-details.html">Study Details &amp; methods</a></li>

            </ul>
            <p class="small">
              Any real-world use should follow ethical guidelines: informed consent for surveys,
              respect for students’ privacy, and transparency about what’s being measured and why.

          The Civic Engagement Experiment &amp; Lab is run by a student who splits time
