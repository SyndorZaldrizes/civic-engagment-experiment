        <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
        <section>
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Democratic engagement among young adults is widely viewed as both a chronic problem and
            a crucial site of opportunity. Concerns about low youth turnout, uneven participation,
            and growing distrust of political institutions have generated a large literature on
            youth civic and political engagement. At the same time, young people increasingly
            encounter politics through campuses, workplaces, and digital communities that are
            themselves structured by organizations and norms. Yet much of the empirical work on
            student participation remains focused on informational and procedural barriers—how to
            register students, how to reduce transaction costs—rather than on how organizational
            cultures shape engagement, especially for those who do not comfortably fit dominant
            political identities.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project starts from a different premise: that democratic engagement is not just an
            individual trait or a function of partisan mobilization, but a relational outcome
            produced by the civic organizations people inhabit. Following Hertel-Fernandez’s (2024)
            work on unions and cross-pressured members, I argue that organizations can foster
            participation among politically ambivalent or ideologically misaligned individuals when
            they cultivate inclusive norms of participation, frame engagement around shared
            non-partisan identities, and emphasize local stakes rather than distant partisan
            conflict. A college campus, with its dense web of student organizations, civic programs,
            and administrative initiatives, is an ideal setting to test these ideas.
          </p>
          <p>
            The long-run goal is a multi-campus, multi-method research agenda that could plausibly
            grow into a dissertation project. As a first step, this paper develops the theoretical
            framework and proposes a campus-based pilot experiment on democratic engagement among
            college students, designed to generate evidence for or against the value of scaling the
            study to a larger number of institutions.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK -->
        <section>
          <h2>Theoretical Framework: Civic Organizations and Cross-Pressured Members</h2>
          <p>
            Classic work on civic associations emphasizes their role in fostering political skills,
            social networks, and opportunities for collective action. Contemporary research has
            extended this tradition, showing that youth organizations and structured group
            experiences promote civic and political engagement by offering meaningful opportunities
            for participation and socialization into democratic norms. Parallel literatures on
            framing and political communication emphasize that how issues and participation are
            framed shapes not only opinions but also political behavior.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hertel-Fernandez contributes to this conversation by focusing on “cross-pressured”
            individuals—members whose ideological or partisan preferences do not fully align with
            their organization’s political activities. In a study of a teachers’ union in a
            right-to-work state, he shows that local leaders who build strong “cultures of
            participation” can engage conservative members in union political activities despite
            ideological disagreement. These leaders frame political action through shared
            occupational identity (as educators), focus on local issues (such as school funding and
            working conditions), and cultivate norms that participation is a core expectation of
            membership. Under these conditions, conservative members report stronger perceptions of
            representation and higher levels of political engagement.
          </p>
          <p>
            This perspective challenges more pessimistic views that cross-cutting organizations will
            demobilize members who disagree with some of their positions. Instead, it suggests that
            organizational design—how leaders talk about politics, whose identities are centered,
            what norms are emphasized—can help bridge ideological divides.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- CAMPUS-BASED CIVIC ENGAGEMENT -->
        <section>
          <h2>Campus-Based Civic Engagement: What We Know and What We Do Not</h2>
          <p>
            On college campuses, a parallel literature has focused mainly on voter registration and
            turnout. Bennion and Nickerson’s (2016) multi-campus field experiment in college
            classrooms shows that even relatively simple, classroom-based voter registration
            presentations can increase student registration by roughly six percentage points and
            turnout by about two to three percentage points. Hill and Lachelier (2014) find that
            face-to-face mobilization efforts can boost student turnout in campus contexts,
            reinforcing the idea that personal contact matters. More recently, Michelson (2024)
            analyzes nationwide efforts to promote student voter registration through the Ask Every
            Student initiative and related programs, documenting positive associations between
            exposure to campus registration efforts and reported registration and turnout,
            especially among first-year students.
          </p>
          <p>
            This body of work demonstrates that colleges and universities can, under the right
            conditions, move student participation. However, several limitations remain. First, most
            studies focus on administrative or procedural interventions: distributing forms in
            class, sending emails, coordinating tabling, or simplifying access to online
            registration. Second, the dominant outcomes are registration and turnout, which are
            important but do not fully capture broader democratic engagement, such as participation
            in deliberative forums, campus governance, or issue-based organizing. Third, little
            attention has been paid to the experiences of cross-pressured or politically
            “out-of-place” students: those whose ideological views or social identities do not match
            the visible political climate of their campus, and who may be especially wary of overtly
            partisan appeals.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, broader work on youth civic engagement emphasizes that adolescents and
            young adults often encounter democracy through group-based experiences where identities
            and norms are negotiated, not just through formal political instruction. Research on
            initiatives like Ask Every Student underscores that students face cognitive and
            psychological hurdles—uncertainty about where to register, anxiety over choosing a
            party, skepticism about whether they belong in politics—that extend beyond mere lack of
            information. When these barriers intersect with campus political cultures that appear
            homogeneous or hostile, cross-pressured students may be especially likely to withdraw.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bridging these literatures suggests a new question: can campus organizations and civic
            programs borrow strategies from union contexts to foster inclusive cultures of
            participation that bring politically diverse students, including cross-pressured ones,
            more fully into democratic life?
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- RESEARCH QUESTION AND CORE CLAIMS -->
        <section>
          <h2>Research Question and Core Claims</h2>
          <p>The central research question is:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p>
              How do organizational communication frames and participatory norms shape democratic
              engagement among college students, especially those who experience political
              cross-pressure or perceive themselves as misaligned with the campus political climate?
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p>The core claims are as follows:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Framing claim:</strong> Messages that frame civic engagement in terms of
              shared campus identity and local stakes will be more effective at promoting
              democratic engagement than neutral administrative messages or messages emphasizing
              national partisan conflict.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Norms claim:</strong> Messages that explicitly highlight strong descriptive
              norms of participation (“students here typically participate in…”) will increase
              engagement by signaling that civic participation is expected and socially supported.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cross-pressure claim:</strong> These effects will be particularly pronounced
              for cross-pressured students—those who report ideological or partisan views that
              differ from what they perceive as the dominant campus political orientation, or who
              feel uncomfortable with visible campus activism.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </section>

        <!-- CAMPUS PILOT EXPERIMENT -->
        <section>
          <h2>The Campus Pilot Experiment</h2>
          <p>
            To test these claims, I propose a survey experiment embedded in a campus-wide online
            study of student civic and political engagement.
          </p>

          <h3>Population and Sampling</h3>
          <p>
            The pilot will be conducted at a single liberal-arts campus. Participants will be
            recruited via:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Announcements in introductory political science and general education courses.</li>
            <li>Campus-wide email invitations.</li>
            <li>
              Outreach through student government and selected, non-partisan student organizations.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The target sample size is approximately 150–250 respondents, sufficient for detecting
            moderate treatment effects and, more importantly, for generating effect-size estimates
            for future power analyses.
          </p>

          <h3>Measures</h3>
          <p>The survey will measure:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Demographic and background variables:</strong> year in school, major,
              race/ethnicity, gender, first-generation status, residence (on- vs off-campus).
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Political identity and cross-pressure:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Ideology on a standard seven-point scale (from “very liberal” to “very
                  conservative”).
                </li>
                <li>Partisan identification, including leaners and non-identifiers.</li>
                <li>
                  Perceived campus political climate (e.g., “Most politically active students here
                  lean liberal/conservative”).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Items capturing discomfort or misfit (“I feel out of place when politics is
                  discussed on this campus”; “I rarely see my views represented in campus political
                  conversations”).
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Democratic engagement outcomes:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Self-reported likelihood of voting in the next national or state election.</li>
                <li>
                  Willingness to participate in campus civic activities (forums, town halls,
                  petition signing, contacting administrators or elected officials).
                </li>
                <li>
                  Internal and external political efficacy tailored to campus politics (“I feel that
                  students like me can influence campus decisions”).
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Behavioral outcomes:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  After the experimental treatment, students will be offered a real opportunity to:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Sign up for a non-partisan civic engagement mailing list, and/or</li>
                    <li>
                      Indicate interest in attending a specific campus civic event. Click-through and
                      sign-up behavior provide observable measures of engagement that complement
                      self-reports.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Experimental Treatments</h3>
          <p>
            Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four conditions, each consisting of a
            brief, realistic message purportedly from a campus civic engagement office or student
            organization:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Neutral control:</strong> A short message providing generic information about
              campus resources and upcoming events, with minimal reference to politics or civic
              engagement.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Partisan conflict frame:</strong> A message emphasizing national-level
              partisan conflict and the importance of “fighting for your side” in a polarized
              environment, with campus participation framed as a way to influence national
              politics.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Identity + local stakes frame:</strong> A message framing civic engagement as
              part of being a responsible member of the campus community, highlighting local stakes
              such as student services, campus funding decisions, and institutional policies. The
              emphasis is on students’ shared identity as members of the same institution rather
              than on partisan identity.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Identity + local stakes + norms frame:</strong> The same content as condition
              3, but with added descriptive norms: for example, stating that many students
              participate in at least one civic activity each semester, or that students routinely
              engage in campus decision-making. The aim is to signal that participation is ordinary
              and expected, not exceptional or deviant.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            These conditions operationalize, in a campus context, the distinction between national
            partisan framing and the organizational strategies identified by Hertel-Fernandez in
            union settings: identity-based, locally grounded, norm-rich appeals.
          </p>

          <h3>Analytical Strategy</h3>
          <p>
            The primary analyses will estimate the average treatment effect of each condition on
            both attitudinal and behavioral outcomes, using linear or logistic regression models as
            appropriate. To test the cross-pressure claim, I will include interaction terms between
            treatment indicators and measures of cross-pressure/misalignment (e.g., ideological
            distance from perceived campus norm, reported discomfort in campus political
            discussions).
          </p>
          <p>
            The pilot is not meant to deliver definitive causal estimates at a fine level of
            precision. Instead, it is designed to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Demonstrate feasibility of recruitment and randomization procedures.</li>
            <li>Test measurement strategies for cross-pressure and perceived misfit.</li>
            <li>
              Generate preliminary estimates of treatment effects, particularly among
              cross-pressured students, to inform power analyses for a larger, multi-campus study.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- SCALING UP -->
        <section>
          <h2>Scaling Up: Toward a Multi-Campus Dissertation Project</h2>
          <p>
            Building on the pilot, the research can be scaled into a dissertation-level project in
            at least two ways.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, a <strong>multi-campus field experiment</strong> could embed similar framing and
            norms manipulations into real-world outreach—email campaigns, event invitations, and
            tabling materials—across a diverse set of institutions (public and private, large and
            small, ideologically varied). This design would allow for:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Random assignment of communication frames at the email or event level.</li>
            <li>
              Measurement of actual participation (event attendance, registration for civic
              programs, joining organizations).
            </li>
            <li>
              Multi-level modeling of treatment effects as a function of campus-level characteristics
              (overall political climate, organizational density, institutional commitments to civic
              engagement).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Second, the project could integrate <strong>qualitative components</strong>—
            interviews with campus organizers, focus groups with cross-pressured students—
            analogous to Hertel-Fernandez’s interviews with union leaders, to better understand how
            organizational actors construct inclusive or exclusive cultures of participation and how
            students interpret those signals.
          </p>
          <p>
            In combination, these approaches would move beyond one-off registration drives to a
            richer theory of how campus civic cultures are built and sustained, and how they affect
            different segments of the student population.
          </p>

            Existing research demonstrates that youth civic engagement is malleable and that
            educational and organizational interventions can meaningfully affect registration,
            turnout, and broader forms of participation. Hertel-Fernandez’s work on unions suggests
            that cross-pressured individuals are not doomed to disengagement; under the right
            organizational conditions, they can be drawn into political life through norms of
            participation, identity-based framing, and locally grounded appeals.
          </p>
          <p>
            By treating the college campus as a laboratory of democracy, this project seeks to test
            whether similar organizational strategies can be used to foster democratic engagement
            among politically diverse students, including those who feel out of place in the
            dominant campus political culture. The proposed pilot experiment is a first step: a
            structured, empirically grounded test of how different communication frames and norms
            shape engagement. Depending on the results, the project can either justify scaling up to
            a multi-campus, dissertation-level study—if the evidence points to promising effects—or
            provide clear reasons to reconsider the theoretical assumptions and redesign
            interventions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Either outcome advances our understanding of how organizations can cultivate inclusive
            democratic participation, not by erasing disagreement, but by building civic cultures in
            which students with different political views still see themselves as entitled—and
            expected—to show up.

          <h3>Control: Neutral Campus Information</h3>
          <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Campus resources and upcoming opportunities</p>
          <p>Dear [Student First Name],</p>
          <p>
            Welcome to another busy semester at [College Name]. We want to make sure you know about
            a few resources and opportunities that are available to you as a student.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>

            <li>

              service, and recreation. You can browse current organizations on the [Student
              Involvement] webpage.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Counseling and Wellness Center provides confidential support for stress, anxiety,
              and other challenges you may face during the year.

              Upcoming events include workshops on study skills, career planning, and financial
              literacy, as well as social events sponsored by student organizations.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We encourage you to explore these opportunities and make use of the resources that best
            fit your needs and interests this semester.
          </p>
          <p>Sincerely,<br />[Office Name]<br />[College Name]</p>

          <h3>Partisan Conflict Frame</h3>
          <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Politics is polarized—your voice can help shape the outcome</p>
          <p>Dear [Student First Name],</p>
          <p>
            You are living through one of the most polarized moments in modern American politics.
            National debates over economic policy, reproductive rights, climate change, and
            democracy itself are sharply divided. In this environment, it is easy to feel that
            politics is something happening “out there,” decided by others.
          </p>
          <p>
            But students at [College Name] have the chance to take a stand. When you engage in civic
            and political activities—attending events, speaking up, voting—you help push our country
            in the direction you believe is right and push back against those who would move it the
            other way. Every election, every policy debate, and every public decision is shaped by
            which side shows up and which side stays home.
          </p>
          <p>
            By getting involved now, you can make sure your side is represented when it matters.
            Whether you feel strongly about national issues or simply want your values to be heard,
            your participation is a way of joining the broader struggle over the future of the
            country.
          </p>
          <p>Sincerely,<br />[Office Name]<br />[College Name]</p>

          <h3>Identity + Local Stakes Frame</h3>
          <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Your campus, your community, your say</p>
          <p>Dear [Student First Name],</p>
          <p>
            [College Name] is not just a place where you take classes. It is a community that you
            help shape every day. Decisions made here—about housing, tuition and fees, student
            services, mental health support, campus safety, and how resources are
            allocated—directly affect your experience as a student.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many of those decisions are influenced by whether students make their voices heard. When
            students attend forums, share feedback, meet with campus leaders, and participate in
            organized efforts, it changes how the institution sets priorities. When students stay
            silent, decisions are more likely to be made without their perspectives in mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            Civic engagement on campus is not about taking a particular partisan position. It is
            about being an active member of the [College Name] community and insisting that students
            have a meaningful role in shaping the policies and practices that affect their daily
            lives. Regardless of your political views, you have a stake in how this campus works—
            and your participation matters.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you are interested in learning more about opportunities to engage with campus
            decision-making this semester, you can sign up after this message to receive information
            about upcoming events and ways to get involved.

          <p>Sincerely,<br />[Office Name]<br />[College Name]</p>

          <h3>Identity + Local Stakes + Norms Frame</h3>
          <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Most students want a say in how our campus is run</p>
          <p>Dear [Student First Name],</p>
          <p>
            [College Name] is a community, and students play a crucial role in how it operates.
            Decisions about housing, tuition and fees, student services, mental health resources,
            campus safety, and other key issues directly shape your experience here.
          </p>
          <p>
            Students at [College Name] care about these decisions. In recent surveys and events,
            many students have said that having a voice in campus life is important to them, and
            each semester students participate in forums, meetings, and initiatives that inform how
            the college makes choices. Speaking up is not something reserved for a small group of
            activists—it is a normal part of being a student here.
          </p>
          <p>
            Civic engagement on campus is not about supporting a particular party or ideology. It is
            about being an engaged member of the [College Name] community and making sure that
            student perspectives are part of the conversation before decisions are made. Whatever
            your political views, your participation signals that students should be taken seriously
            when it comes to how this place is run.
          </p>
          <p>
            After this message, you will have the option to sign up for more information about
            upcoming opportunities to share your views and get involved in campus decision-making.
            Adding your name is a simple way to join the many students who already take part in
            shaping our community.
          </p>
